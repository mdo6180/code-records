1. use the following commands to generate self-signed cert and key
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_root.key -out certificate_root.pem -config openssl.cnf
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout private_leaf.key -out certificate_leaf.pem -config openssl.cnf

2. run `python leaf.py` and `python root.py` in separate terminals
3. visit https://localhost:8001/ in chrome and click on Advanced → Proceed to localhost (unsafe). this allows us to manually accept the certificate for the leaf.
4. visit https://localhost:8000/ in chrome and click on Advanced → Proceed to localhost (unsafe). this allows us to manually accept the certificate for the root.
