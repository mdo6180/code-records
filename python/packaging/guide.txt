building package and uploading to PyPI:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi

make sure to install build, twine, and wheel
$ pip install build
$ pip install twine
$ pip install wheel

create a setup.py file (see the setup.py file in this directory)
create a pyproject.toml file (see the pyproject.toml file in this directory)

create ~/.pypirc file (config file for PyPI so you don't have to keep entering your password)
note: API token in ~/.pypirc file must have pypi- prefix
[pypi]
username = __token__
password = <API token>

[pypitest]
username = [your username]
password = [your password]

build wheel (note: this should create a folder called dist/)
$ python3 -m build 

If rebuilding the package, do the following:
1. change the version number.
2. delete the dist/ folder (if present).

upload package onto PyPI
$ twine upload dist/*

note: if .pypirc file isn't in ~; we can still use it like so:
$ twine upload --config-file=.pypirc dist/*

testing to see if the distribution works:

create a virtual environment
$ python3 -m venv virtualenv

install the package
$ pip install <package name>
