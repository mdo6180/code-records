Setup guide

Adding new user to instance:

Step 1: create IAM user
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html
Note: make sure user is in the same region, e.g., in the case of northern Virginia, its us-east-1
Test: check if new user can see and turn on the instance in the console

Step 2: creating new user / deleting user on EC2 instance
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html

Step 3: creating new key pair
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/create-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair
Note: user will have to manually run chmod 400 on their end

Step 4: create user in instance
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/managing-users.html
Note: log in as ec2-user (aka root user), then create the user

Step 5: Giving users sudo access
https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sudo-privileges-user
Test: check if user can now log onto instance
Note: sudoers file is at /etc/sudoers
Note: run "sudo visudo" to edit the /etc/sudoers file
Note: copy last two lines to enable user to access without a password
